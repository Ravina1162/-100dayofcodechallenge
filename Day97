QUESTION : Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences

A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.

You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a single sentence.

Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.

ANSWER :
import java.util.*;
class Solution {
    public int mostWordsFound(String[] sentences) {
        int g=0;
        for(int i=0;i<sentences.length;i++)
        {
            StringTokenizer s=new StringTokenizer(sentences[i]);
            int c=s.countTokens();
            if(c>g)
                g=c;
        }
        return g;
    }
}

EXAMPLE 1:

Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
- The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
- The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
- The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.

Constraints:

1 <= sentences.length <= 100
1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100
sentences[i] consists only of lowercase English letters and ' ' only.
sentences[i] does not have leading or trailing spaces.
All the words in sentences[i] are separated by a single space.
