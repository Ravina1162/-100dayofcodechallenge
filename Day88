QUESTION : Valid Perfect Square
Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.

 
ANSWER :
class Solution {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
         long lb=1,ub=num;
    while(lb<=ub){
        long mid=lb+(ub-lb)/2;
        if(mid*mid==num) return true;
    else if(mid*mid>num)
        ub=mid-1;
    else
         lb=mid+1;
    }
   return false;
    }
}

EXAMPLE 1:

Input: num = 16
Output: true
Explanation: We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.

Constraints:

1 <= num <= 231 - 1
